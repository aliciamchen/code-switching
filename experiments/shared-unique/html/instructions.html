<h2>üí¨ Part 1: Communication game üí¨</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>
    In the first part of the task, you will observe two groups of players
    playing a communication game. The players are real participants who
    previously played this game in an earlier study.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each player belongs to one of two groups: the
    <span class="red-bold">red</span> group or the
    <span class="blue-bold">blue</span> group. There are four players in each
    group. The players interact with other members of their own group throughout
    the game.

<h2>üí¨ Part 1: Communication game üí¨</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>How does the communication game work?</p>
  <p>
    Everyone playing the game sees the same set of 6 pictures, which will look
    something like this:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="PLACEHOLDER_TANGRAMS_SRC" alt="Tangram set" width="30%" />
  </div>
  <p>
    In each group, there are 4 players. In each round, one of the players in the
    group is assigned the Speaker role and the others are assigned the Listener
    role.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Speaker sees a box secretly marking one of the pictures as the target:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="PLACEHOLDER_TARGET_SRC" alt="Tangram target" width="30%" />
  </div>
  <p>
    The Speaker's job is to send a description of the target through the chatbox
    so that the Listeners are able to pick it out of the set. They can write
    whatever description they think will best allow the Listeners to identify
    the target.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the Speaker sends a message, the Listeners read it and each click the
    picture they believe is the target. They are also allowed to respond by
    sending messages back through the chatbox until they are ready to make a
    selection. At that time, everyone will be given feedback: the Speaker sees
    which picture each of the Listeners selected, and the Listeners each see
    what the correct picture was.
  </p>
  <p>
    In each round, the Speaker communicates about each of the 6 pictures. Then,
    the Speaker role then rotates to the next player, and the next round begins.
  </p>

<h2>üí¨ Part 1: Communication game üí¨</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>We will show you videos of the gameplay.</p>
  <p>
    For each round and group, there will be 6 videos, one for each of the 6
    pictures. Each video displays the conversation between the players. At the
    end of each video, you will see what the target picture was, as well as what
    each player selected.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Speaker's messages will be on the left side of the chatbox and the
    Listeners' messages will be on the right side of the chatbox. Here is an
    example video:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <video src="PLACEHOLDER_VIDEO_SRC" controls width="60%"></video>
  </div>
  <p>
    There are a total of 6 rounds in the game. You will see the gameplay for
    each of the two groups before moving on to the next round. So, for example,
    you'll see Round 1 for the red group, and then Round 1 for the blue group,
    and then Round 2 for the red group, and then Round 2 for the blue group, and
    so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the chat messages displayed in the videos are sped up to
    facilitate reading through them.
  </p>
  <p>
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Please pay attention during this first part of the task! You will need to
    use what you have observed in this part, to earn the highest possible bonus
    in the second part of the task. ‚ö†Ô∏è

<h2>ü§® Part 2: Questions ü§®</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>
    In the second part of the task, it will be <strong>up to you</strong> to
    choose words that go with these pictures.
  </p>
  <p>
    On each screen, you will see two pictures with a word describing each, and
    you will have to pick one of them. We will tell you
    <strong>who</strong> will see your choice (a member of the red group, a
    member of the blue group, or a member of either group) and
    <strong>what question</strong> they will be answering when they see it. Your
    goal is to try to get them to answer the question in a certain way based on
    the word you select.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please read carefully, so you know <strong>who</strong> will see the picture
    and words you chose, <strong>what question</strong> they will be answering,
    and <strong>how</strong> you want them to answer it.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will do this 69 times. In addition to your base pay of $10, you will
    receive a bonus of $0.10 for each correct choice, for a total bonus of up to
    $7. Please note that it may take a few days for us to award your bonus.
