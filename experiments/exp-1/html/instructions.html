    This study consists of two parts. In the first part, you will observe two
    groups of players, each group playing a communication game. In the second
    part, you will answer some questions based on what you have observed in the

<h2>üí¨ Part 1: Communication game üí¨</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>
    In the first part of the task, you will observe two groups of players
    playing a communication game. The players are real participants who
    previously played this game in an earlier study.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each player belongs to one of two groups: the
    <span class="red-bold">red</span> group or the
    <span class="blue-bold">blue</span> group. There are four players in each
    group. The players interact with other members of their own group throughout
    the game.

<h2>üí¨ Part 1: Communication game üí¨</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>How does the communication game work?</p>
  <p>
    Everyone sees the same set of 6 pictures, which look something like this:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="stim/images/tangrams.png" alt="Tangram set" width="30%" />
  </div>
  <p>
    In each group, there are 4 players. In each round, one of the players in the
    group is assigned the Speaker role and the others are assigned the Listener
    role.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Speaker sees a box secretly marking one of the pictures as the target:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <img
      src="stim/images/target-tangram.png"
      alt="Tangram target"
      width="30%"
    />
  </div>
  <p>
    The Speaker's job is to send a description of the target through the chatbox
    so that the Listeners are able to pick it out of the set. They can write
    whatever description they think will best allow the Listeners to identify
    the target.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the Speaker sends a message, the Listeners read it and each click the
    picture they believe is the target. They are also allowed to respond by
    sending messages back through the chatbox until they are ready to make a
    selection. At that time, everyone will be given feedback: the Speaker sees
    which picture each Listeners selected, and the Listeners each see whether
    their selection was correct or not.
  </p>
  <p>
    In each round, the Speaker communicates about each of the 6 pictures once.
    Then, the Speaker role then rotates to the next player, and the next round
    begins.
  </p>

<h2>üí¨ Part 1: Communication game üí¨</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>We will show you videos of the gameplay.</p>
  <p>
    For each round and group, there will be 6 videos, one for each of the 6
    pictures. Each video displays the conversation between the players. At the
    end of each video, you will see what the target picture was, as well as what
    each player selected.
  </p>
  <p>
    The speaker's messages will be on the left side of the chatbox and the
    listeners' messages will be on the right side of the chatbox. Here is an
    example video:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <video
      src="stim/convo_vids/videos/480p15/item_0_red_target_A_repnum_0.mp4"
      controls
      width="60%"
    ></video>
  </div>
  <p>
    There are a total of 6 rounds in the game. You will see the gameplay for
    each of the two groups before moving on to the next round. So, for example,
    you'll see Round 1 for the red group, and then Round 1 for the blue group,
    and then Round 2 for the red group, and then Round 2 for the blue group, and
    so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the chat messages displayed in the videos are sped up to
    facilitate reading through them! But, feel free to pause the videos and/or
    take your time to read through the chat messages.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to earn the highest possible bonus, please pay attention during
    this first part of the task. You will need to use what you have observed in
    this part, to answer the questions in the second part of the task.
  </p>
</div>
<!-- PAGE BREAK -->
<h2>ü§® Part 2: Questions ü§®</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>
    In the second part of the task, you will answer some questions based on what
    you observed in the first part.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are a total of 12 questions. For each question, you will be given two
    answers to select from, each option a picture with its corresponding
    description.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em
      >The descriptions you choose will be sent to the players of the game you
      just observed!</em
    >
    For each question, we will tell you (1) <em>who</em> will see the desciption
    you select; and (2) <em>what</em> we will prompt them to answer, based on
    the description you select. Your job is to choose the description that you
    think will help them best answer the question.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, after the task ends, we will send your responses and their
    corresponding questions to the players, for them to answer. You will earn an
    additional bonus, up to XXX, based on how correctly the players in the game
    answer the questions using your responses. (Please note that it will take a
    few days for the players to answer the questions and for us to calculate
    your bonus.)
