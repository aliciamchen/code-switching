      <h2>Phase 1: Reference Game</h2>
      <p>
        In the first phase, you will be assigned to a group with 4 players,
        including yourself. You will play a communication game with the players
        in your group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone playing the game sees the same set of 6 pictures, which will
        look something like this:
      </p>
      <div className="tangrams grid">{tangramsNoTarget}</div>
      <p>
        In each round, one of the players in the group is assigned the Speaker
        role and the others are assigned the Listener role.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Speaker sees a box secretly marking one of the pictures as the
        target:
      </p>
      <div className="tangrams grid">{tangramsWithTarget}</div>{" "}
      <p>
        The Speaker's job is to send a description of the target through the
        chatbox so that the Listeners are able to pick it out of the set. They
        can write whatever description they think will best allow the Listeners
        to identify the target. Please note that{" "}
        <b>the order of the pictures on your screen is scrambled</b>, so
        descriptions like "the one on the left" or "the third one" will not
        work. Also, please limit your description to the current target picture:{" "}
        <strong>
          do not discuss previous trials or chat about any other topics!
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Speaker sends a message, the Listeners read it and each click
        the picture they believe is the target. They are also allowed to respond
        by sending messages back through the chatbox until they are ready to
        make a selection. At that time, everyone will be given feedback: the
        Speaker sees which picture each of the Listeners selected, and the
        Listeners each see what the correct picture was.
      </p>
      <p>
        In each round, the Speaker communicates about each of the 6 pictures.
        Then, the Speaker role then rotates to the next player, and the next
        round begins.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a total of 12 rounds in this phase, so each player will
        communicate about each of the 6 pictures twice.

      <h2>Scores and bonuses</h2>
      <p>
        In each task, we use "score" to evaluate the quality of the selections
        that you and your partner have made. Your total score will be calculated
        as the sum of the scores on each phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each time a <strong>Listener</strong> makes a correct selection, they
        get <strong>3 points</strong>.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Both an incorrect selection and no selection (timing out) earn no
        points.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Speaker</strong> gets a bonus equal to{" "}
        <strong>the average</strong> of the Listeners's scores. For example, if
        all three listeners select the correct picture, the Speaker will get a
        bonus of 3 points. If two listeners select the correct picture and one
        does not, the Speaker will get a bonus of 2 points.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the first phase, you will proceed to the next phases of
        the task. We will give you more information about these phases when you
        get there.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a total of 486 points in all phases of the study. In addition
        to your base pay of $12, you will receive $0.02 per point, for a total
        bonus of up to $9.72.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Remember, free riding is not permitted. If we detect that you are
          inactive during a task, you will not receive a bonus for that task.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        After you pass the comprehension quiz, you will be put into a waiting
        lobby. When there are enough players to start the game, the game will
        begin. Please note that it might take up to 5 minutes to find enough
        players.
