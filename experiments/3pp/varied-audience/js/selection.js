        On each screen, you will see two labels describing a picture, and
        you will have to pick one of them. We will tell you
        <strong>what audience</strong> will see your choice (a number of blue-group members, 
        and participants who played this game in a separate, unspecified group) 
        and <strong>what question</strong> they will be answering when
        they see it. Your goal is to try to get them to answer the question in a
        certain way based on the label you select.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please read carefully, so you know <strong>who</strong> will see the picture
        and words you chose, <strong>what question</strong> they will be answering,
