<h2>üí¨ Part 1: Communication game üí¨</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>
    In the first part of the task, you will observe a group of four players
    playing a communication game. The players are real participants who
    previously played this game in an earlier study.
  </p>

<h2>üí¨ Part 1: Communication game üí¨</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>How does the communication game work?</p>
  <p>
    Everyone playing the game sees the same set of 6 pictures, which will look
    something like this:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="PLACEHOLDER_TANGRAMS_SRC" alt="Tangram set" width="30%" />
  </div>
  <p>
    In each group, there are 4 players. In each round, one of the players in the
    group is assigned the Speaker role and the others are assigned the Listener
    role.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Speaker sees a box secretly marking one of the pictures as the target:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="PLACEHOLDER_TARGET_SRC" alt="Tangram target" width="30%" />
  </div>
  <p>
    The Speaker's job is to send a description of the target through the chatbox
    so that the Listeners are able to pick it out of the set. They can write
    whatever description they think will best allow the Listeners to identify
    the target.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the Speaker sends a message, the Listeners read it and each click the
    picture they believe is the target. They are also allowed to respond by
    sending messages back through the chatbox until they are ready to make a
    selection. At that time, everyone will be given feedback: the Speaker sees
    which picture each of the Listeners selected, and the Listeners each see
    what the correct picture was.
  </p>
  <p>
    In each round, the Speaker communicates about each of the 6 pictures. Then,
    the Speaker role then rotates to the next player, and the next round begins.
  </p>

<h2>üí¨ Part 1: Communication game üí¨</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>We will show you videos of the gameplay.</p>
  <p>
    For each round there will be 6 videos, one for each of the 6 pictures. Each
    video displays the conversation between the players. At the end of each
    video, you will see what the target picture was, as well as what each player
    selected.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Speaker's messages will be on the left side of the chatbox and the
    Listeners' messages will be on the right side of the chatbox. Here is an
    example video:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <video src="PLACEHOLDER_VIDEO_SRC" controls width="60%"></video>
  </div>
  <p>
    There are a total of 6 rounds in the game. Note that the chat messages
    displayed in the videos are sped up to facilitate reading through them.
  </p>
  <p>
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Please pay attention during this first part of the task! You will need to
    use what you have observed in this part, to earn the highest possible bonus
    in the second part of the task. ‚ö†Ô∏è

<h2>ü§® Part 2: Questions ü§®</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>
    In the second part of the task, it will be <strong>up to you</strong> to
    choose words that go with these pictures.
  </p>
  <p>
    On each screen, you will see two pictures with a word describing each, and
    you will have to pick one of them. We will tell you
    <strong>who</strong> will see your choice (a number of players from the game
    you observed, and a number of players who have not played this game) and
    <strong>what question</strong> they will be answering when they see it. Your
    goal is to try to get them to answer the question in a certain way based on
    the label you select.
  </p>
  <p>We will display the audience using colored avatars; for example:</p>
  PLACEHOLDER_AVATARS_SRC
  <p>
    The <span style="color: blue">blue avatars</span> are members of the group
    that you observed in the first part of the task. The
    <span style="color: gray">gray avatars</span> are participants you did not
    observe, who have not played this game before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please read carefully, so you know <strong>who</strong> will see the picture
    and words you chose, <strong>what question</strong> they will be answering,
    and <strong>how</strong> you want them to answer it.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will do this 66 times. In addition to your base pay of $10, you will
    receive a bonus of $0.10 for each correct choice, for a total bonus of up to
    $6.60. Please note that it may take a few days for us to award your bonus.
