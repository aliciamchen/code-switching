    This study consists of two parts. In the first part, you will observe two
    groups of players playing a communication game. In the second part, you will
    answer some questions based on what you have observed in the first part.

<h2>üí¨ Part 1: Communication game üí¨</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>
    In the first part of the task, you will observe two groups of players
    playing a communication game. The players are real participants who
    previously played this game in an earlier study.
  </p>

<h2>üí¨ Part 1: Communication game üí¨</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>How does the communication game work?</p>
  <p>
    Each group sees the same set of 12 pictures, which will look something like this:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="PLACEHOLDER_TANGRAMS_SRC" alt="Tangram set" width="30%" />
  </div>
  <p>
    In each group, there are 4 players. In each round, one of the players in the
    group is assigned the Speaker role and the others are assigned the Listener
    role.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Speaker sees a box secretly marking one of the pictures as the target:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="PLACEHOLDER_TARGET_SRC" alt="Tangram target" width="30%" />
  </div>
  <p>
    The Speaker's job is to send a description of the target through the chatbox
    so that the Listeners are able to pick it out of the set. They can write
    whatever description they think will best allow the Listeners to identify
    the target.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the Speaker sends a message, the Listeners read it and each click the
    picture they believe is the target. They are also allowed to respond by
    sending messages back through the chatbox until they are ready to make a
    selection. At that time, everyone will be given feedback: the Speaker sees
    which picture each of the Listeners selected, and the Listeners each see
    what the correct picture was.
  </p>
  <p>
    In each round, the Speaker communicates about 8 of the 12 pictures. Then,
    the Speaker role then rotates to the next player, and the next round begins.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>üí¨ Part 1: Communication game üí¨</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>
    The two groups are the <strong>red group</strong> and the
    <strong>blue group</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each round there will be videos showing the conversation between the
    players. Each video displays the conversation between the players. At the
    end of each video, you will see what the target picture was, as well as what
    each player selected.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Speaker's messages will be on the left side of the chatbox and the
    Listeners' messages will be on the right side of the chatbox. Here is an
    example video:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <video src="PLACEHOLDER_VIDEO_SRC" controls width="60%"></video>
  </div>
  <p>
    There are a total of 6 rounds in the game. Note that the chat messages
    displayed in the videos are sped up to facilitate reading through them.
  </p>
  <p>We will show you videos of the gameplay in three phases:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Phase 1:</strong> First round for both groups (red and blue)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Rounds 2-5 for the blue group</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Final round for both groups</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Please pay attention during this first part of the task! You will need to
    use what you have observed in this part for the second part of the task. ‚ö†Ô∏è

<h2>ü§® Part 2: Questions ü§®</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>
    In the second part of the task, it will be <strong>up to you</strong> to
    write descriptions that go with these pictures.
  </p>
  <p>
    On each screen, you will pick a picture, and write a description for that picture.
    We will tell you
    <strong>who</strong> will see your description (a number of players from the blue
    group, and a number of players who have not played this game) and
    <strong>what question</strong> they will be answering when they see it. Your
    goal is to try to get them to answer the question in a certain way based on
    the description you write.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> Note that on each trial, you will not be able to
    choose the same picture as you chose on the previous trial.
  </p>
  <p>We will display the audience using colored avatars; for example:</p>
  PLACEHOLDER_AVATARS_SRC
  <p>
    The <span style="color: blue">blue avatars</span> are members of the blue
    group that you observed in the first part of the task. The
    <span style="color: gray">gray avatars</span> are participants you did not
    observe (i.e. in neither the blue nor red groups), who have not played this
    game before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please read carefully, so you know <strong>who</strong> will see the picture
    and words you chose, <strong>what question</strong> they will be answering,
    and <strong>how</strong> you want them to answer it.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will do this 53 times. In addition to your base pay of $6, you will
    receive a bonus of $0.10 for each correct choice, for a total bonus of up to
    $6. Please note that it may take a few days for us to award your bonus.
