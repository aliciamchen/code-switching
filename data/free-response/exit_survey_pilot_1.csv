5d453e8723a5bb0001492546,yes,30,male,"I understood the instructions, but there are alternative interpretations that I feel are reasonable. The instructions asked for a label. My initial reading of this word was that label meant an identifying description. For example, a warning label on medication or cigarettes. As I progressed through the experiment and the reality of entering 56 short descriptions kicked in, I began to wonder whether label was meant in the sense of an identifier. For example, a plastic bottle labeled ""Bleach"". I didn't mind the extra work, but now I am left wondering whether I misunderstood the intended instruction and should have tried to think of quirky, yet descriptive shorthand references. All good other than that. Good luck with your research!"

6642db87936f64e56b101a9b,yes,35,female,The instructions when being tested on what I was to do in part 2. The quiz question kind of made it like a trick question and it took me a couple tries to answer correctly. It was unclear whether a description would be done or an actual label. Things like that left me uncertain whether I understood. I think I did get it though.
